## Example
See the testefs cartridge source code in ```src/ef``` as example. You can find 
the build test cartridge in the build directory: ```build/test-libefs.crt```

## Bugs

I did not test the library thoroughly. There are some tests to
validate the basic functions and a long running test thats reads, scratches
and saves files repeatadly. But there are many cases that the simple tests
do not cover. I consider the library "alpha" quality. The features 
are there but largely untested. Use at your own risk. Some features have not
been implemented yet.
