ToDo
====

- different library variants
  + read and open only, no write, no verify
    does not need extra space
    average performance
  + better performance and verify
    needs appr. 128 (half page) of non-bankable memory
    ($0100-$7fff, $c000-$cfff)
  + write
    needs appr. another 128 bytes og non-bankable memory
  + variant could be set at runtime

- read directory "$"
- open implementation
  + commands: none
  + open does all preparations
  + chrin only loads characters, no zeropage in chrin
  + close does nothing (ends state)
- close implementation
- chrin implementation

- save
  + commands: scratch, validate (defragment)
  + additional errors: 
    26:write protected
    72:disk full
    63:file exists
- ef can have several file systems
  + basic read-only file system: dir in 00:1:0000 - 00:1:17ff
  + at least two freely positioned file systems for read/write
  + these must always span full eraseable blocks
  + these start with xx:0:0000 - xx:0:17ff as directory, followed by data
  + these can wrap in LL, HH or LH
  + saving can fail due to fragmentation
